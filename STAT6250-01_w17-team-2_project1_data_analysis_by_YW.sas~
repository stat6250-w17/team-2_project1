This file uses the following analytic dataset to address several research
questions regarding CAASP test results 

Dataset Name: CAASP1516_analytic_file created in external file
STAT6250-01_w17-team-2_project1_data_preparation.sas, which is assumed to be in 
the same directory as this file

See included file for dataset properties

Research Question 1: What's the difference between the mean scores of students who 
are economically disadvantaged and those who are not?

Methodology: Use PROC MEANS to compute the mean scores for the data input of data-
set and output the results to a temporary dataset. Use PROC SORT extract and sort 
just the means the temporary data-set, and use PROC PRINT to print just the subset 
of students who are economically disadvantaged and those who are not disadvantaged

Rationale: What's the economic status effect on the test score?
